This is a batch "operating system".              Please dont take the "Operating system" part too seriously..

Most of the code was made by me, however some fixes have been made by AI..
Take the code if you want it, but i dont know in what way it would be useful.


If you look inside the code you will find a "randomnumber" section which is not shown on the "desktop", this is intentional, to open it simply press "i" on the desktop.
